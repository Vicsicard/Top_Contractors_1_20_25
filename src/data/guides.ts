      { heading: 'The 50% Rule', body: "The industry standard: if repair cost exceeds 50% of full replacement cost, replace the roof. For a Denver home where replacement costs $12,000–$15,000, repairs over $6,000–$7,500 typically justify replacement. But age and damage type matter just as much." },
      { heading: 'Age-Based Decision Framework', body: "Under 10 years: Repair almost always makes sense unless damage is catastrophic.\n\n10–15 years: Evaluate carefully. Isolated storm damage may still justify repair. Widespread wear warrants replacement.\n\nOver 15–20 years: Replacement is usually the right call. You're near end of life for asphalt shingles in Denver's climate.\n\nOver 25 years: Replace. Full stop." },
      { heading: 'Types of Damage: Repair vs. Replace', body: "Repair is appropriate for: isolated storm damage, a few missing shingles, minor flashing issues, a single leak from one penetration.\n\nReplace when: hail damage covers 25–30%+ of the roof, granule loss is widespread, multiple leaks in different areas, sagging or structural damage." },

Structural issues are the most expensive thing to fix in a rebuild.\n\nThe layout works with modifications. If you can achieve your goals without moving load-bearing walls or reconfiguring the entire floor plan, remodeling is far more cost-effective.\n\nThe neighborhood supports the investment. If comparable homes sell for $600,000–$800,000, a $200,000 remodel on a $400,000 home makes financial sense.\n\nYou want to preserve character. Older Denver homes in neighborhoods like Highlands, Congress Park, and Park Hill have architectural character that's impossible to replicate in new construction." },
      { heading: 'When Rebuilding Makes More Sense', body: "Rebuilding is worth considering when:\n\nThe home has fundamental structural problems — failing foundation, extensive rot, significant settling. Fixing these in a remodel often costs as much as rebuilding.\n\nThe layout is irreparably inefficient. Some older Denver homes have layouts that can't be improved without essentially rebuilding anyway.\n\nThe lot value exceeds the home value. In high-demand Denver neighborhoods, the land itself may be worth more than the existing structure.\n\nYou want modern construction standards.

Modular or production builds: $150–$250/sq ft.\n\nThe cost difference is often smaller than homeowners expect — a gut renovation of an older Denver home frequently approaches new construction costs once structural issues, code upgrades, and systems replacement are factored in." },
      { heading: 'The Decision Framework', body: "Ask these questions:\n\n1. What is the land worth alone? If the lot value is high, rebuilding preserves more flexibility.\n2.

A reputable bathroom remodeler manages licensed subcontractors and pulls all required permits." },
      { heading: 'Waterproofing Is the Most Critical Factor', body: "The most common bathroom remodel failure is inadequate waterproofing. Ask specifically: What waterproofing system do you use in the shower? The answer should reference a specific product — Schluter Kerdi, RedGard, Wedi, or similar.\n\n'We use cement board' is not a complete waterproofing answer — cement board is not waterproof. A contractor who can't answer this question specifically is a red flag." },
      { heading: 'Portfolio and References', body: "Always review a portfolio of completed Denver bathrooms before hiring. Look for: consistent grout lines, quality tile work, frameless glass installation quality, and overall design cohesion.\n\nAsk for 2–3 references from bathroom projects completed in the past 12 months.

    intro: "Painting is one of the most competitive contractor markets in Denver — and one where quality varies most. A great paint job lasts 8–12 years. A poor one peels within 2–3. Denver's UV intensity and temperature swings make prep work especially critical. Here's how to hire right.",

Ask for certificates and verify they're current.\n\nUninsured painters working on your property create significant liability exposure if someone is injured." },
      { heading: "Surface Prep Is Everything in Denver's Climate", body: "Denver's 300+ days of sunshine at high altitude degrades paint faster than lower-elevation cities. UV radiation breaks down paint film, causing chalking, fading, and peeling.\n\nProper prep for exterior painting in Denver: pressure washing, scraping all loose paint, sanding rough edges, caulking all gaps and penetrations, priming bare wood and repaired areas.\n\nAsk: What is your prep process? How long does prep take relative to painting? A quality exterior job should spend 40–60% of labor time on prep. Painters who skip prep produce work that fails in 2–3 years in Denver's climate." },
