      { heading: 'The 50% Rule', body: "The industry standard: if repair cost exceeds 50% of full replacement cost, replace the roof. For a Denver home where replacement costs $12,000–$15,000, repairs over $6,000–$7,500 typically justify replacement. But age and damage type matter just as much." },
      { heading: 'Age-Based Decision Framework', body: "Under 10 years: Repair almost always makes sense unless damage is catastrophic.\n\n10–15 years: Evaluate carefully. Isolated storm damage may still justify repair. Widespread wear warrants replacement.\n\nOver 15–20 years: Replacement is usually the right call. You're near end of life for asphalt shingles in Denver's climate.\n\nOver 25 years: Replace. Full stop." },
      { heading: 'Types of Damage: Repair vs. Replace', body: "Repair is appropriate for: isolated storm damage, a few missing shingles, minor flashing issues, a single leak from one penetration.\n\nReplace when: hail damage covers 25–30%+ of the roof, granule loss is widespread, multiple leaks in different areas, sagging or structural damage." },

Structural issues are the most expensive thing to fix in a rebuild.\n\nThe layout works with modifications. If you can achieve your goals without moving load-bearing walls or reconfiguring the entire floor plan, remodeling is far more cost-effective.\n\nThe neighborhood supports the investment. If comparable homes sell for $600,000–$800,000, a $200,000 remodel on a $400,000 home makes financial sense.\n\nYou want to preserve character. Older Denver homes in neighborhoods like Highlands, Congress Park, and Park Hill have architectural character that's impossible to replicate in new construction." },
      { heading: 'When Rebuilding Makes More Sense', body: "Rebuilding is worth considering when:\n\nThe home has fundamental structural problems — failing foundation, extensive rot, significant settling. Fixing these in a remodel often costs as much as rebuilding.\n\nThe layout is irreparably inefficient. Some older Denver homes have layouts that can't be improved without essentially rebuilding anyway.\n\nThe lot value exceeds the home value. In high-demand Denver neighborhoods, the land itself may be worth more than the existing structure.\n\nYou want modern construction standards.

The answer should reference a specific product — Schluter Kerdi, RedGard, Wedi, or similar.\n\n'We use cement board' is not a complete waterproofing answer — cement board is not waterproof. A contractor who can't answer this question specifically is a red flag." },

Solid hardwood must acclimate to your home's humidity for 3–7 days before installation — non-negotiable.\n\nAsk: How long will you acclimate the flooring before installation?

    intro: "Painting is one of the most competitive contractor markets in Denver — and one where quality varies most. A great paint job lasts 8–12 years. A poor one peels within 2–3. Denver's UV intensity and temperature swings make prep work especially critical. Here's how to hire right.",
    sections: [
      { heading: 'Licensing and Insurance for Denver Painters', body: "Colorado does not require a state license for painting contractors. Denver requires a city contractor license for commercial work, but residential painting is largely unregulated.\n\nThis makes due diligence especially important. At minimum, require: general liability insurance ($1M minimum) and workers' compensation. Ask for certificates and verify they're current.\n\nUninsured painters working on your property create significant liability exposure if someone is injured." },
      { heading: "Surface Prep Is Everything in Denver's Climate", body: "Denver's 300+ days of sunshine at high altitude degrades paint faster than lower-elevation cities. UV radiation breaks down paint film, causing chalking, fading, and peeling.\n\nProper prep for exterior painting in Denver: pressure washing, scraping all loose paint, sanding rough edges, caulking all gaps and penetrations, priming bare wood and repaired areas.\n\nAsk: What is your prep process? How long does prep take relative to painting? A quality exterior job should spend 40–60% of labor time on prep. Painters who skip prep produce work that fails in 2–3 years in Denver's climate." },
      { heading: 'Paint Quality Matters More in Denver', body: "Premium exterior paints (Sherwin-Williams Duration, Benjamin Moore Aura, PPG Timeless) cost $60–$90/gallon but are specifically formulated for UV resistance and flexibility.\n\nAsk: What brand and product line of paint will you use? The answer should be specific. 'A good quality paint' is not an acceptable answer.\n\nFlexible acrylic latex paints handle Denver's dramatic daily temperature swings (40°F common) better than oil-based options. Avoid contractors who propose oil-based exterior paint." },
      { heading: 'What a Good Painting Quote Includes', body: "A complete painting quote should specify: paint brand, product line, and number of coats; prep work included (pressure wash, scrape, caulk, prime); areas included and excluded; whether furniture moving is included; cleanup and protection of landscaping; and a warranty on labor (minimum 2 years for exterior).\n\nGet 3 quotes. Significant price differences usually reflect differences in prep, paint quality, or number of coats — ask each contractor to explain their process." },

    intro: "Window replacement is a significant investment — and one where the contractor matters as much as the product. Poor installation negates the performance of even premium windows. Denver's altitude, UV intensity, and temperature extremes make both product selection and installation quality critical.",
    sections: [
      { heading: 'Licensing and Credentials for Window Contractors', body: "Colorado does not require a specific window installation license. Denver requires a city contractor license. Always verify general liability insurance and workers' compensation before work begins.\n\nFor energy-efficient window claims, look for contractors who are certified installers for the brands they sell. Andersen, Pella, and Marvin have certified installer programs. Certification means the contractor has been trained on proper installation for that specific product." },
      { heading: 'Window Specs That Matter for Denver', body: "Denver's climate requires specific window performance specs:\n\nU-factor: 0.30 or lower for Denver's cold winters. This measures heat loss — lower is better.\n\nSHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient): 0.25–0.35 for most Denver homes. Balances winter solar gain with summer heat rejection.\n\nLow-E coating: Essential for Denver. Reflects UV and infrared radiation, reducing summer heat gain and winter heat loss.\n\nGas fill: Argon or krypton between panes — verify it's included, not just offered as an upgrade.\n\nAsk any window contractor to provide the NFRC label specs for the windows they're proposing. If they can't, that's a red flag." },
      { heading: 'Installation Quality — The Critical Factor', body: "The most common window failure is improper installation, not product defects. Proper window installation in Denver requires:\n\nFlashing: Water-resistive barrier and flashing tape around every window opening. Critical in Denver's hail and wind-driven rain environment.\n\nInsulation: Gaps between window frame and rough opening must be filled with low-expansion foam — not fiberglass batts, which allow air infiltration.\n\nLeveling and squaring: Windows must be perfectly plumb, level, and square. Improper alignment causes operational problems and seal failure.\n\nAsk: What is your flashing process? What do you use to insulate around the frame? Specific answers indicate experience." },
      { heading: 'Getting and Comparing Window Quotes', body: "Get 3 quotes. Each should specify: window manufacturer and product line, frame material, glass package (U-factor, SHGC, Low-E, gas fill), installation process including flashing, removal and disposal of old windows, and warranty on both product and labor.\n\nBe cautious of contractors who only sell one brand — a reputable window contractor can explain why their recommended product is the best fit for your home and budget, not just what they happen to carry." },
