    sections: [
      { heading: 'The 50% Rule', body: "The industry standard: if repair cost exceeds 50% of full replacement cost, replace the roof. For a Denver home where replacement costs $12,000–$15,000, repairs over $6,000–$7,500 typically justify replacement. But age and damage type matter just as much." },
      { heading: 'Age-Based Decision Framework', body: "Under 10 years: Repair almost always makes sense unless damage is catastrophic.\n\n10–15 years: Evaluate carefully. Isolated storm damage may still justify repair. Widespread wear warrants replacement.\n\nOver 15–20 years: Replacement is usually the right call. You're near end of life for asphalt shingles in Denver's climate.\n\nOver 25 years: Replace. Full stop." },
      { heading: 'Types of Damage: Repair vs. Replace', body: "Repair is appropriate for: isolated storm damage, a few missing shingles, minor flashing issues, a single leak from one penetration.\n\nReplace when: hail damage covers 25–30%+ of the roof, granule loss is widespread, multiple leaks in different areas, sagging or structural damage." },
      { heading: 'The Insurance Factor in Denver', body: "Denver's hail frequency means many replacements are insurance-funded.

      { q: 'How do I know if my roof has hail damage?', a: 'Look for dents on metal components, bruising or granule loss on shingles, and cracked or missing shingles. A free inspection from a licensed Denver roofer is the most reliable assessment.' },

Your general contractor should handle all applications." },

      { heading: 'Key Code Requirements Denver Homeowners Encounter', body: "Smoke and CO detectors: Required on every level, in every bedroom, and outside sleeping areas.

    sections: [
      { heading: 'When Remodeling Makes More Sense', body: "Remodeling is usually the better choice when:\n\nThe home has good bones — solid foundation, sound structure, quality framing. Structural issues are the most expensive thing to fix in a rebuild.\n\nThe layout works with modifications. If you can achieve your goals without moving load-bearing walls or reconfiguring the entire floor plan, remodeling is far more cost-effective.\n\nThe neighborhood supports the investment. If comparable homes sell for $600,000–$800,000, a $200,000 remodel on a $400,000 home makes financial sense.\n\nYou want to preserve character. Older Denver homes in neighborhoods like Highlands, Congress Park, and Park Hill have architectural character that's impossible to replicate in new construction." },
      { heading: 'When Rebuilding Makes More Sense', body: "Rebuilding is worth considering when:\n\nThe home has fundamental structural problems — failing foundation, extensive rot, significant settling. Fixing these in a remodel often costs as much as rebuilding.\n\nThe layout is irreparably inefficient. Some older Denver homes have layouts that can't be improved without essentially rebuilding anyway.\n\nThe lot value exceeds the home value. In high-demand Denver neighborhoods, the land itself may be worth more than the existing structure.\n\nYou want modern construction standards. New builds offer better insulation, energy efficiency, and systems integration than most remodels can achieve." },
      { heading: 'Cost Comparison in Denver', body: "Major whole-house remodel in Denver: $150–$400/sq ft depending on scope and finishes.\n\nNew construction in Denver: $250–$450/sq ft for custom builds. Modular or production builds: $150–$250/sq ft.\n\nThe cost difference is often smaller than homeowners expect — a gut renovation of an older Denver home frequently approaches new construction costs once structural issues, code upgrades, and systems replacement are factored in." },
      { heading: 'The Decision Framework', body: "Ask these questions:\n\n1. What is the land worth alone? If the lot value is high, rebuilding preserves more flexibility.\n2. What percentage of the home needs to be replaced? Over 50% suggests rebuild.\n3. Does the existing structure have problems that can't be fixed cost-effectively?\n4.
