âœ“ Completed: Error Handling Improvements

1. Database Functions (Completed)
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for database queries
- Improved error logging with detailed context
- Modified functions to return empty arrays/null instead of throwing errors
- Added proper TypeScript types for Supabase responses
- Updated error handling to be consistent across all database functions

2. Test Coverage (Completed)
- Updated test cases to match new error handling behavior
- Added tests for retry logic
- Added tests for empty array/null returns on errors
- Improved test mocks with proper error types

3. Page Components (Verified)
- Confirmed existing error handling in page components works with new database behavior
- notFound() handling remains appropriate for missing data
- Error boundaries already in place for component-level errors

Result:
- Static site generation now continues even when some data is unavailable
- Improved error logging helps with debugging
- More resilient database operations with retry logic
- Consistent error handling across the application
- Full test coverage for error cases
